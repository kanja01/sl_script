# Your SoftLayer API username and key.
# Generate an API key at the SoftLayer Customer Portal:

# The id of the virtual server which contains the alarm you wish to delete
# you can get the virtual guest ID by calling the SoftLayer_Account::getVirtualGuests method
# for more reference see: http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/getVirtualGuests
# eg.
# client = SoftLayer.Client(username=username,api_key=key)
# accountService = client['SoftLayer_Account']
# virtualServers = accountService.getVirtualGuests();
# print (virtualServers)
virtualServerID = 4979090

# The start date and end date that you want to search an specific alarm

# The alarm's message you wish to delete
messageAlarm = "BootAlarm: Computer has been rebooted at 2014.7.3 14:31:39"

# Declare a new API service object
client = SoftLayer.Client()
virtualGuestService = client['SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest']

# Getting all the active alarms in the Virtual Server
activeAlarms = virtualGuestService.getMonitoringActiveAlarms(startDate, endDate, id = virtualServerID)
# Looking for the alarm which contains the specific message
for alarm in activeAlarms:
