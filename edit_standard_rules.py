# Edit Standard Rule
# A rule set of a firewall is modified by passing a SoftLayer_Network_Firewall_Update_Request template object
# to SoftLayer_Network_Firewall_Update_Request::createObject. The entire rule set is rewritten with each
# update request. This means it is necessary to include all past unchanged rules along with any modifications
# or additions. This is easily accomplished by pulling in the existing rules as described above then modifying
# the gathered array.
# Each SoftLayer_Network_Component_Firewall_Update_Request_Rule object requires:
#
# action - permit or deny
# destinationIpAddress - destination address
# destinationIpSubnetMask - subnet mask for destination
# sourceIpAddress - originating address
# sourceIpSubnetMask - subnet mask for origin address
# protocol - tcp/udp
# destinationPortRangeStart - first port the rule will effect
# destinationPortRangeEnd - last port the rule will effect
# orderValue - order in which rules are applied (lower is sooner)
