Order a new server.

Build a SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order object for a new server order
and pass it to the SoftLayer_Product_Order API service to order it.
In this care we'll order a Single Intel Xeon E5-2620 with 8G RAM, 100mbit NICs,
500GB bandwidth, a 500G SATA drive, no Operating system, and default server order options.
See below for more details.

to tell the SoftLayer API which options you want in your new server. Use
the getActivePackages() method in the SoftLayer_Account API service to get
a list of available item and price options per available package.
